| Sep 9  | 10:00 - 10:30 |                                                                                                                   Cloned repository in class, and began thinking of a good algorithm for determining the total cost. Check HighwaysAndHospitals.java for info. Also began coding basic BFS and redesigned the class so I could store instance variables rather than having to pass the variables I need to each function I call. |

Unfortunately, clearly there was something wrong in my logic. I'm trying to understand what I had programmed and why it works but I am genuinely confused by what I was thinking. I pass the correctness tests, but don't pass the efficiency tests due to incorrect answers. |

Unfortunately I still fail to pass one of the efficiency tests (the large one) by about 300ms, so I am trying to find a way to make the BFS either more efficient or find another more optimal algorithm. |
| Sep 12 |  7:15 - 7:30  | Worked on this in the train... very relaxing. I figured that our goal wasn't really to find the shortest path, but to count the # of islands of nodes, so BFS had no advantages over DFS... actually it had a disadvantage. It required a queue and just overall performed many more operations per cycle if you will... So I switched to DFS and that fixed all of my efficiency problems. My code now passes all of the tests. |

Also modified the HighwaysAndHospitals class to be compatible with the original test class. Also cleaned up the code and added some improved comments. |

Found a really well written Wikipedia article explaining the history of union-find, the different types, details about the algorithm, and more. |

This is significantly faster than using DFS. |
