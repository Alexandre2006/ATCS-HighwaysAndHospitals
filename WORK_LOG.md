| Sep 9  | 10:00 - 10:30 |                 Cloned repository in class, and began thinking of a good algorithm for determining the total cost. Check HighwaysAndHospitals.java for info. Also began coding basic BFS and redesigned the class so I could store instance variables rather than having to pass the variables I need to each function I call. |
| Sep 10 | 10:00 - 10:40 | Finished coding the BFS algorithm and tested it. Unfortunately, clearly there was something wrong in my logic. I'm trying to understand what I had programmed and why it works but I am genuinely confused by what I was thinking. I pass the correctness tests, but don't pass the efficiency tests due to incorrect answers. |
| Sep 10 | 14:00 - 14:25 |                                                                                   Figured out the correct algorithm. Unfortunately I still fail to pass one of the efficiency tests (the large one) by about 300ms, so I am trying to find a way to make the BFS either more efficient or find another more optimal algorithm. |
